# since the array is sorted , we can use two pointers,
# we start with the first and last number 1 + 15 = 16 > 13
# since sum is > target we move the right pointer 1 + 14 = 15 > 13
# 1+ 9 = 10 < 13 so now we have to move the left pointer to increase the sum
# 2 + 9 = 11 < 13, 4 + 9 = 13 = 13 so the numbers are 4 and 9 we know that since the array is sorted
# there are not other numbers in the array that give us the sum because if we move forward our left pointer
# the sum will be greater than the target the same with the right pointer since its decrease the sum
